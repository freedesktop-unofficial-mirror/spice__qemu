1. USB CCID device

The USB CCID device is a USB device implementing the CCID specification, which
lets one connect smart card readers that implement the same spec. For more
information see the specification:

 Universal Serial Bus
 Device Class: Smart Card
 CCID
 Specification for
 Integrated Circuit(s) Cards Interface Devices
 Revision 1.1
 April 22rd, 2005

Smartcard are used for authentication, single sign on, decryption in
public/private schemes and digital signatures. A smartcard reader on the client
cannot be used on a guest with simple usb passthrough since it will then not be
available on the client, possibly locking the computer when it is "removed". On
the other hand this device can let you use the smartcard on both the client and
the guest machine. It is also possible to have a completely virtual smart card
reader and smart card (i.e. not backed by a physical device) using this device.

2. Building

prerequisites:
 libcaccard

At the moment there are no binary or source releases, so it has to be retrieved
from source control:

    git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/~alon/cac_card

fedora:
    yum install nss-devel
ubuntu:
    apt-get install libnss3-dev
    (not tested on ubuntu)

build cac_card:
    cd cac_card
    ./configure && make && sudo make install

qemu:
    ./configure --enable-smartcard && make

Note that if you install to a non default prefix you need to set
PKG_CONFIG_PATH to compile qemu successfully.

3. Using ccid-card-emulated with hardware

Assuming you have a working smartcard on the host with the current
user, using NSS, qemu acts as another NSS client using ccid-card-emulated:

    qemu -usb -device usb-ccid -device ccid-card-emualated

4. Using ccid-card-emulated with certificates

You must create the certificates. This is a one time process. We use NSS certificates:

    certutil -d /etc/pki/nssdb -x -t "CT,CT,CT" -S -s "CN=cert1" -n cert1

Note: you must have exactly three certificates.

Assuming the current user can access the certificates (use certutil -L to verify),
you can use the emulated card type with the certificates backend:

    qemu -usb -device usb-ccid -device ccid-card-emulated,backend=certificates,cert1=cert1,cert2=cert2,cert3=cert3

5. Using ccid-card-passthru with client side hardware

on the host specify the ccid-card-passthru device with a suitable chardev:

    qemu -chardev socket,server,host=0.0.0.0,port=2001,id=ccid,nowait -usb -device usb-ccid -device ccid-card-passthru,chardev=ccid

on the client run vscclient, built when you built the libcaccard library:
    vscclient <qemu-host> 2001

6. Using ccid-card-passthru with client side certificates

Run qemu as per #5, and run vscclient as follows:
(Note: vscclient command line interface is in a state of change)

    ./vscclient -e "db=\"/etc/pki/nssdb\" use_hw=no soft=(,Test,CAC,,cert1,cert2,cert3)" <qemu-host> 2001

7. Passthrough protocol scenario

This is a typical interchange of messages when using the passthru card device.
usb-ccid is a usb device. It defaults to an unattached usb device on startup.
usb-ccid expects a chardev and expects the protocol defined in cac_card/vscard_common.h to be passed over that.
A typical interchange is:

client event      |      vscclient           |    passthru    |     usb-ccid  |  guest event
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                  |      VSC_Init            |                |               |

                  |                          |                |               |  guest operation, APDU transfer via CCID

                  |      VSC_APDU            |                |               |

8. libcaccard

ccid-card-passthru and vscclient use libcaccard as the card emulator.
libcaccard implements a completely virtual CAC (DoD standard for smart cards)
compliant card and uses NSS to actually retrive certificates and do any
encryption using the backend (real reader + card or file backed certificates).

For documentation of cac_card see README in libcac_card package.
